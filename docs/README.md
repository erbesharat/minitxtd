# Documentation

For configuration examples for the caddy plugin look at our [examples section](/examples/README.md#configuration)

# Specification
*The implementation and specification are a work in progress*

## TXT record
### Basic requirements
* Record must not exceed 255 characters
* Record key-value pairs must be delimited by semicolons ";"
* Key and value must be encoded using utf8
* Punycode for domain names should be used
* Ordering key-value pairs can be done
* Arbitrary data/non key-value pairs can be used and will be ignored

### Location
* TXT record must be accessible under the subdomain "\_redirect"

### URLs
* All URLs must be encoded
* ";" must be escaped as "%3B"

Examples:  
    ; -> %3B  
    ? -> %3F  
    = -> %3D  
`https://example.com/page/about=us -> https://example.com/page/about%3Dus`

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-11

For multi-level tlds such as `example.co.uk`, `co` would be used as `{label2}`, `example` would be `{label1}` and `uk` would be `{label3}`

### type=host
*v*
* Mandatory
* Permitted values: "txtv0"

*to*
* Recommended
* Default: Fallbacks such as `www` or `redirect` config
* Permitted values: "absolute/relative URL"
